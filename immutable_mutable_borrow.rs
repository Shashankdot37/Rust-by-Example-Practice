// Your Task
//     Define a Book struct with those fields.
//     Implement two functions:
//         fn print_info(book: &Book)
//         ðŸ“˜ Takes an immutable reference, and prints the book's info.
//         fn mark_unavailable(book: &mut Book)
//         ðŸ”’ Takes a mutable reference and sets available = false.
//     In main():
//         Create a book.
//         Immutably borrow it and print its info.
//         Then mutably borrow it to mark it as unavailable.
//         Try immutably borrowing it again after itâ€™s been mutably borrowed and modified.
//     Lastly, try mutably borrowing it while itâ€™s already immutably borrowed, and observe the compiler error â€” comment it out with explanation.
